# HeatFlowModeling

### Overview ###
Initially created for a class, Nanomanufacturing for Sustainability, I built on the code to allow for simulating multiple materials in parallel. The parallelization is achieved through MATLAB's Parallel Computing Toolbox. 

The code itself numerically solves a system of differential equations to calculate the temperature a film of material will settle at given a set of conditions like solar irradiance, the material's properties, the ambient temperature, etc.  

Below is a picture of the equations used.
